    "text": "I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics, advised by Marco Carone and Alex Luedtke. My research interests include methods for health systems and health policy research, causal inference, analysis of EHR data, and survival analysis.\nMy dissertation research, previously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, was on causal inference methods for individualized treatment rules. My collaborative research included the analysis of a clinical trial studying an intervention intended to promote goals-of-care discussions between patients and providers in a palliative care setting; this work was supervised by Lyn Brumback. I also collaborated with researchers at the UW Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute on a retrospective cohort study using healthcare claims data.\nIn addition to research, I am invested in teaching statistical and epidemiology concepts at an undergraduate and graduate level. I served as the instructor for an undergraduate course on regression methods for public health, as a co-instructor for a graduate-level data analysis course, created and facilitated three guided reading projects for students, and as a teaching assistant for several courses. See my teaching page for more details.\nBefore beginning my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Grinnell College and spent a year as an Americorps VISTA volunteer."
