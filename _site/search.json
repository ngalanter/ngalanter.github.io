    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics advised by Marco Carone and Alex Luedtke. My research interests include methods for health systems and health policy, causal inference, analysis of EHR data, and survival analysis. My dissertation research, previously supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, is on causal inference methods for individualized treatment rules. My collaborative research includes the analysis of a clinical trial studying an intervention intended to promote goals-of-care discussions between patients and providers in a palliative care setting; this work is supervised by Lyn Brumback. I have also collaborated on several projects related to time-to-event outcomes.\nIn addition to research, I am invested in teaching statistical and epidemiology concepts at an undergraduate and graduate level. I served as the instructor for a undergraduate course on regression methods for public health, have created and facilitated three guided reading projects for students, and served as a teaching assistant for several courses. See my teaching page for more details.\nBefore beginning my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Grinnell College and spent a year as an Americorps VISTA volunteer."
